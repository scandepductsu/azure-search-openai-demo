Ample Metal Ray5 is compatible with Windows and Mac systems, and supports VST2, VST3, AU, AAX and standalone formats. It requires 10 GB of hard disk space and an Intel i5 processor or higher. The plugin uses direct from disk (DFD) technology to reduce RAM usage and loading time. You can also adjust the buffer size and polyphony settings to optimize the performance.
 
The plugin features a detailed sampling of the bass guitar, with over 8 GB of samples and 9 articulations, including sustain, palm mute, natural harmonic, hammer on & pull off, legato slide, slide in & out, accentuated, repeat note, and dead note. You can control the articulations with key switches, velocity, or MIDI CC. You can also use the poly legato and slide smoother functions to create smooth transitions between notes.
 
One of the highlights of Ample Metal Ray5 is the CPC (Customized Parameters Control) system, which allows you to assign any button, knob, or slider to a MIDI CC or automation lane. This gives you more flexibility and creativity in shaping your sound. You can also use the alternate tuner to change the tuning of each string individually, or use the multiple capo logics to automatically adjust the fingering according to different scenarios.
 
Another feature that sets Ample Metal Ray5 apart from other bass plugins is the built-in amp system, which includes three classic amp models: Vintage-15, Bass-500, and Bass-Pro. You can also choose from four cabinet models: 1x15, 2x10, 4x10, and 8x10. Each cabinet has four mic options: U87, C414, MD421, and SM57. You can also blend in some room mics for a more natural sound. The amp system also has a bypass switch if you prefer to use your own external amp simulator.
