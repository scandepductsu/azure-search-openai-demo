There are several possible causes for this error, such as antivirus interference, corrupted files, incompatible versions, or missing permissions. In this article, we will show you some solutions to fix this error and make Cheat Engine work again.
 
## Solution 1: Disable or Uninstall Antivirus Software
 
One of the most common reasons for the Dbk32.dll error is that your antivirus software may block or delete the Dbk32.dll driver, as it may consider it a potential threat.

## Solution 2: Replace the Dbk32.dll Driver with an Unsigned Version
 
Another possible reason for the Dbk32.dll error is that the driver that comes with Cheat Engine 6.2 is signed, which means that it has a digital signature that verifies its authenticity. However, some Windows versions may not accept this signature and refuse to load the driver. To fix this, you can replace the Dbk32.dll driver with an unsigned version, which does not have a signature and can be loaded by Windows. However, you need to boot up Windows with unsigned driver support, which may reduce your system security. You can download the unsigned version of Dbk32.dll from [here](http://cheatengine.org/temp/dbk64-unsigned.rar) [^1^].
 
## Solution 3: Use the Kernel Module Unloader
 
Sometimes, the Dbk32.dll error may occur because the driver is already loaded by another instance of Cheat Engine or another program, and it cannot be unloaded by Cheat Engine 6.2. To solve this, you can use the Kernel Module Unloader tool that comes with Cheat Engine 6.2, which can unload any kernel module from memory. You can find this tool in the Cheat Engine installation folder, under Tools\Kernelmoduleunloader.
 
## Solution 4: Run Cheat Engine as Administrator
 
Finally, the Dbk32.dll error may happen because Cheat Engine does not have enough permissions to load the driver and access the memory of other processes. To fix this, you can try to run Cheat Engine as administrator, which will grant it more privileges and allow it to load the driver successfully. To do this, right-click on the Cheat Engine icon and select Run as administrator.
