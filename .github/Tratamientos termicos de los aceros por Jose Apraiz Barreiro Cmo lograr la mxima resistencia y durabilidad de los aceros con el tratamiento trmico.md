Thermal treatments of steels are processes that modify the microstructure and properties of steel alloys by applying heat and cooling cycles. They are widely used in metallurgy and engineering to improve the performance and durability of steel components. Thermal treatments can affect the hardness, toughness, strength, ductility, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and fatigue resistance of steels.
 
One of the most comprehensive and authoritative books on this topic is "Tratamientos Termicos de Los Aceros" by Jose Apraiz Barreiro, a professor of metallurgy and siderurgy at the Technical School of Industrial Engineers of Bilbao, Spain. The book was first published in 1967 and has been updated and revised several times since then. The latest edition, published in 2003 by CIE Dossat 2000, has 737 pages and covers the theoretical and practical aspects of thermal treatments of steels in depth.

The book is divided into four parts: general concepts, thermal treatments of carbon steels, thermal treatments of alloy steels, and special thermal treatments. The first part introduces the basic principles of phase transformations, diffusion, kinetics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer that govern the thermal treatments of steels. The second part describes the main types of thermal treatments of carbon steels, such as annealing, normalizing, quenching, tempering, austempering, martempering, patenting, spheroidizing, and surface hardening. The third part deals with the thermal treatments of alloy steels, such as low-alloy steels, high-alloy steels, stainless steels, tool steels, maraging steels, and superalloys. The fourth part discusses some special thermal treatments that are applied to specific applications or conditions, such as cryogenic treatment, thermochemical treatment, thermomechanical treatment, laser treatment, and induction heating.
 
The book is written in a clear and rigorous style, with numerous tables, figures, diagrams, graphs, equations, and references to support the explanations. It is intended for students, researchers, engineers, technicians, and professionals who are interested in learning more about the science and technology of thermal treatments of steels. It is also a valuable reference for anyone who works with steel products or processes that involve thermal treatments.
  
The book also includes several examples and exercises that illustrate the application of thermal treatments of steels in various industrial sectors, such as automotive, aerospace, energy, construction, mining, and manufacturing. Some of the applications are:
 
- Heat treatment of steel castings to improve their mechanical properties and reduce segregation and porosity[^1^].
- Heat treatment of steel wires to increase their strength and ductility for making springs, cables, and ropes[^2^].
- Heat treatment of steel tools to enhance their hardness, wear resistance, and cutting performance[^3^].
- Heat treatment of stainless steels to improve their corrosion resistance and prevent intergranular attack.
- Heat treatment of maraging steels to achieve ultra-high strength and toughness for aerospace and defense applications.

In conclusion, "Tratamientos Termicos de Los Aceros" by Jose Apraiz Barreiro is a comprehensive and authoritative book that covers the theory and practice of thermal treatments of steels in detail. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about this important topic in metallurgy and engineering.
