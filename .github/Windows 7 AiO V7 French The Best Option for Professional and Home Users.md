Windows 7 is one of the most popular operating systems in the world, but it is no longer supported by Microsoft since January 2020. This means that users who still use Windows 7 will not receive any security updates or bug fixes, which can expose them to various risks and vulnerabilities. However, some users may still prefer to use Windows 7 for various reasons, such as compatibility, performance, or personal preference.
 
For those users, there is a solution: Windows 7 AiO V7 French. This is a custom edition of Windows 7 that contains all the versions of Windows 7 (Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate) in both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, as well as all the updates and drivers that were released until August 2017. This edition also includes a recovery partition that can help users restore their system in case of any problem.

Windows 7 AiO V7 French was created by mehdibleu, a member of the Le Crabe Info community[^1^], who downloaded all the original ISOs from Microsoft's server and integrated them into one single ISO using a script[^2^]. He also used the boot files of Windows 8.1 to enable the installation of Windows 7 on USB 3.0 ports, which are not supported by default by Windows 7. This way, users can install Windows 7 on modern devices that only have USB 3.0 ports.
 
Windows 7 AiO V7 French is available for free download on SoundCloud[^3^], where users can also listen to a preview of the installation process. The ISO file has a size of about 6 GB and can be burned to a DVD or a USB flash drive using a tool like Rufus. Users can choose their preferred edition and language during the installation process. The ISO file has a SHA256 checksum of 08F6B9F1876BF6C41492D92A15046B45EAF431263B8714B95D64D99EA5AC0BBD to verify its integrity.
 
Windows 7 AiO V7 French is a great option for users who want to keep using Windows 7 with all its features and updates, without compromising their security or compatibility. However, users should be aware that this edition is not official or authorized by Microsoft, and that they still need a valid product key to activate Windows 7. Users should also backup their data before installing Windows 7 AiO V7 French, as it may overwrite their existing system.

Windows 7 AiO V7 French is not the only custom edition of Windows 7 that exists. There are many other editions that have been created by different developers and communities, such as Windows 7 SP1 Multi Language AIO ISO x64, which contains multiple languages and versions of Windows 7 in 64-bit architecture. These editions may have different features, updates, drivers, or modifications that suit different needs and preferences of users.
 
However, users should be careful when downloading and installing these custom editions of Windows 7, as they may contain malware, viruses, or unwanted programs that can harm their devices or data. Users should always check the source and reputation of the edition they want to use, and scan the ISO file with an antivirus program before using it. Users should also read the terms and conditions of the edition they want to use, as they may differ from the original Windows 7 license agreement.
 
Another thing that users should consider when using these custom editions of Windows 7 is that they may not receive any support or assistance from Microsoft or other official sources. Users may encounter problems or issues that are specific to these editions, and that may not be solved by the usual methods or tools. Users may also face legal issues or penalties if they use these editions without a valid license or permission from Microsoft.
