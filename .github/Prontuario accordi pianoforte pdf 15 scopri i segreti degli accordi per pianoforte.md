But how do you use the PDF guide? It's very simple. Just follow these steps:

1. Choose a chord that you want to learn from the list. For example, C major.
2. Look at the graphical representation of the chord on the keyboard. It shows you which keys to press with your fingers. For example, C-E-G.
3. Play the chord on your piano or keyboard. Listen to how it sounds. Try to play it smoothly and evenly.
4. Repeat the same process for the other chords in the same key. For example, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished.
5. Practice switching between chords in the same key. For example, C-F-G-C. This will help you develop your chord transitions and finger movements.
6. Move on to the next key and repeat the same steps. For example, C# major.

By following this method, you will learn all the basic chords in all 12 keys in no time. You will also develop your ear for harmony and your musical intuition.
  
But learning piano chords is not only about memorizing shapes and sounds. It's also about understanding how they work and how they relate to each other. That's why the PDF guide also explains the theory behind chords and chord symbols.
 
You will learn what each chord is made of, and how to name it correctly. You will learn how to build chords from scales, and how to use intervals to identify them. You will learn how to read chord symbols and notation, and how to write them yourself.
 
This will help you understand the logic and structure of music, and how to apply it to your own playing. You will be able to analyze songs and recognize chord patterns and progressions. You will be able to transpose songs to different keys, and modify chords to create variations and effects.
