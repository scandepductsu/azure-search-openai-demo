In this article, we will explore some of the new and improved features that are available in the latest version of PowerFactory, 15.2 50. This version completes the successful series of PowerFactory 15 releases and comes with many enhancements and extensions to the existing modelling suite. It also introduces new electrical models and state-of-the-art algorithms for faster and more accurate calculations and simulations.
 
## General Improvement of Calculation Speed
 
One of the main highlights of PowerFactory 15.2 50 is the general improvement of calculation speed. The software uses new solvers and improved data structures that can handle large and complex networks more efficiently. The calculation speed has been increased by up to 50% for load flow, short circuit and contingency analysis.
 
## Significantly Improved Dynamic Simulation Performance
 
Another major improvement is the dynamic simulation performance. The software uses enhanced algorithms and precompiled controller models that can reduce the simulation time by up to 80%. This allows for faster and more realistic studies of transient phenomena, such as faults, switching events, frequency deviations and control actions.
 
## Generic C Interface for Controller Models
 
PowerFactory 15.2 50 also introduces a new feature that allows users to create their own controller models using the C programming language. The software provides a generic C interface that can be used to define inputs, outputs and parameters of any controller model. The software also includes an automatic DSL to C converter that can translate existing DSL models into C code.
 
## New and Flexible Heatmap Background Colouring Scheme
 
A new feature that enhances the visualisation of network data is the heatmap background colouring scheme. This feature allows users to assign different colours to different ranges of values for any network variable, such as voltage, current, power or frequency. The colours can be customised according to user preferences and can be applied to any network element or area.

## Background Maps Representation Automated via Mapping Server Interface
 
Another feature that improves the graphical representation of networks is the background maps integration. This feature allows users to automatically import geographical maps from online mapping servers, such as Open Street Map, into PowerFactory. The maps can be used as a background layer for network diagrams and can be adjusted according to scale, zoom level and orientation.
 
## Navigation Pane Facility
 
A new feature that facilitates the navigation and organisation of network data is the navigation pane facility. This feature allows users to create customised navigation panes that can display different views of network elements, such as diagrams, tables, charts or reports. The navigation panes can be docked or undocked from the main window and can be arranged according to user preferences.
 
## New Differential Protection Curves
 
A new feature that expands the protection analysis capabilities of PowerFactory is the differential protection curves. This feature allows users to define and display differential protection characteristics for any type of transformer or line differential protection device. The curves can be used to evaluate the sensitivity and selectivity of differential protection schemes.
 
## New Study Case Overview
 
A new feature that simplifies the management of study cases is the study case overview. This feature allows users to view and compare all study cases in a single table that shows their names, descriptions, attributes and results. The table can be sorted, filtered and exported according to user needs.
 
## Improved Python Scripting Module
 
A new feature that enhances the automation and integration of PowerFactory is the improved Python scripting module. This feature allows users to write and execute Python scripts within PowerFactory that can access and manipulate any network data or function. The scripts can be used for customised calculations, simulations, reports or interfaces.
