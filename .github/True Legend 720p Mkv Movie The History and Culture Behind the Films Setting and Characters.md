The film begins with a flashback of Su Can's heroic rescue of the Qing prince from a group of rebels. Su Can is a skilled general who leads a loyal army and wields a legendary sword. He is offered the governorship of Hubei province by the grateful prince, but he declines and gives it to his stepbrother Yuan Lie instead. Su Can wants to retire from the military and pursue his passion for martial arts. He gives his sword to his friend Ma Qingfeng and bids farewell to Yuan Lie, who secretly harbours resentment towards him.
 
Five years later, Su Can lives happily with his wife Yuan Ying and their son Feng. He runs a martial arts school and teaches his students the art of drunken boxing. He also dreams of meeting the God of Wushu and the Old Sage, two legendary masters who can teach him the ultimate secrets of wushu. One day, he receives news that Yuan Lie is returning from the war as a governor. He welcomes him with a feast, but soon realizes that Yuan Lie has come for revenge. Yuan Lie has mastered the Five Venom Fists, a sinister technique that his father learned from a foreigner named Anthony. Yuan Lie blames Su Can's father for killing his father and ruining his life. He kills Su Can's father and challenges Su Can to a duel.
 
Su Can fights bravely, but he is no match for Yuan Lie's poisonous attacks. Yuan Lie injures Su Can's arm and leg, then kidnaps Feng and throws him into a raging river. Su Can jumps into the water to save his son, but they are both swept away by the current. Yuan Ying follows them and finds them on the shore. She sees that Su Can is badly wounded and Feng is barely alive. She takes them to a nearby village, where she meets Dr. Yu, a mysterious woman who offers to heal them.
 
Dr. Yu uses acupuncture and herbal medicine to treat Su Can and Feng. She tells Yuan Ying that Su Can's arm and leg are paralyzed by Yuan Lie's venom, and that Feng's heart has stopped beating. She says that she can revive Feng by using a special technique that involves transferring her own energy to him, but it will shorten her lifespan. Yuan Ying agrees to let her do it, and Dr. Yu succeeds in bringing Feng back to life.
 
Meanwhile, Su Can falls into a coma and has visions of the God of Wushu and the Old Sage. They teach him their respective styles of wushu: the God of Wushu shows him how to use speed, agility, and deception; the Old Sage shows him how to use drunken boxing with internal power. Su Can gradually recovers his strength and mobility, but he also becomes obsessed with revenge. He trains day and night, ignoring his family and friends.
