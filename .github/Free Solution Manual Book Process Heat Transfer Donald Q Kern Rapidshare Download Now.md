## Live Edit without Chrome Extension
 
WebStorm 2018.3 makes Live Edit even easier to use. Live Edit allows you to see the changes you make in your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the browser without reloading the page. Previously, you had to install a Chrome extension to enable this feature. Now, you can simply use the built-in JavaScript debug configuration and start a debugging session. WebStorm will automatically open the page in Chrome and update it as you edit your code.
 
## Extract Ruleset and Move It to Another File
 
WebStorm 2018.3 adds a new refactoring for style sheets. You can now extract a ruleset from a CSS or SCSS file and move it to another file. This can help you organize your style sheets better and avoid duplication. To use this refactoring, select a ruleset in the editor, press Alt-Enter, and choose "Extract ruleset". Then, specify the name and location of the new file.
 
## Structure View for Test Files
 
WebStorm 2018.3 improves the support for testing frameworks, such as Jest, Mocha, and Karma. It now provides a structure view for test files, which shows the hierarchy of test suites and test cases. You can use this view to navigate to a specific test, run or debug it, or jump to its definition in the editor.
