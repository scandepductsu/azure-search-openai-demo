# How to Download and Install Avery DesignPro 5.5 for Windows 10
 
Avery DesignPro 5.5 is a software that allows you to design and print Avery labels, business cards, dividers, t-shirt transfers, greeting cards and more. It has a user-friendly interface and a variety of templates and features to customize your products. However, Avery DesignPro 5.5 is no longer supported by Avery and you may have trouble finding a reliable download link or installing it on Windows 10. In this article, we will show you how to download and install Avery DesignPro 5.5 for Windows 10 without any hassle.
 
## Step 1: Download Avery DesignPro 5.5 from Archive.org
 
The official website of Avery does not offer a download link for Avery DesignPro 5.5 anymore. Instead, they recommend using their online service called Design & Print Online. However, if you prefer to use the offline software, you can still find it on Archive.org[^1^]. Archive.org is a website that preserves digital content and offers free access to millions of books, movies, music, software and more.

3. Choose a destination folder for the software. The default location is C:/Program Files (x86)/Avery Dennison/DesignPro 5/.
4. Click on the "BefejezÃ©s" button (which means "Finish") to complete the installation.
5. Navigate to the destination folder where you installed the software.
6. Rename or delete the WLRCDLL.DLL file that is already in the folder.
7. Copy and paste the WLRCDLL.DLL file that you downloaded from Archive.org into the same folder.
8. Double-click on the DesignPro.exe file to launch the software.
