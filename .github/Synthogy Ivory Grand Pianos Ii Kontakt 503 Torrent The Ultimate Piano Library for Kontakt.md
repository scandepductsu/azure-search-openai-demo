# Synthogy Ivory Grand Pianos II KONTAKT 5.03: A Review
 
If you are looking for a realistic and expressive virtual grand piano collection, you might want to check out Synthogy Ivory Grand Pianos II KONTAKT 5.03. This is an updated version of the popular Ivory Grand Pianos library, which features four stunning pianos: a BÃ¶sendorfer 290 Imperial Grand, a German Steinway D 9' Concert Grand, a Yamaha C7 Grand, and a vintage 1951 Steinway B "Baby" Grand.
 
What makes this library stand out is the improved Ivory II piano DSP engine, which uses Harmonic Resonance Modeling to simulate the natural resonance of the piano strings and soundboard. This adds a rich and organic dimension to the sound, especially when using the sustain pedal. The library also features nearly double the velocity layers of the original Ivory Grand Pianos, which means more detail and nuance in every note.

The library comes with a custom user interface that gives you access to various parameters and effects, such as EQ, reverb, chorus, tremolo, and more.

The interface is easy to use and intuitive, and you can save your own settings as user presets.
