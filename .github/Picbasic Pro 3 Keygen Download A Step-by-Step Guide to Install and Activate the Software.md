## Why Convert EXE to MSI?
 
EXE files are executable files that can run on Windows systems and install applications or perform other tasks. However, they have some limitations when it comes to deploying them in an enterprise environment. For example, they may not support silent installation, require user interaction, or have compatibility issues with different Windows versions.
 
MSI files are Windows Installer Packages that contain all the information and files needed to install, update, or uninstall an application. They support silent installation, customization, and repair options, and can be easily deployed via Active Directory GPO or SCCM. They also have better compatibility with different Windows versions and security features.
 
By converting exe files to msi packages, you can take advantage of these benefits and simplify the software installation process in your organization.
