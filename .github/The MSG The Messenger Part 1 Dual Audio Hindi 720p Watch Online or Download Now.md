The film was met with harsh criticism and protests from various groups who accused it of hurting religious sentiments, promoting superstition and glorifying Singh. The film was banned in several states and faced legal challenges from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) and the Sikh community. However, the film also received support from Singh's followers, who claimed that it was a positive and inspirational message for the youth.
 
The film was released in Hindi, English, Tamil and Telugu languages, and later dubbed in other regional languages as well. The film was also released in dual audio format, with Hindi and English audio tracks. The film was available for download in various resolutions, including 720p HD quality. The film was a commercial success, grossing over Rs. 100 crore at the box office.
 
The MSG The Messenger Part 1 is the first installment of a planned trilogy, followed by MSG-2 The Messenger (2015) and MSG The Warrior Lion Heart (2016). The film has developed a cult following among Singh's devotees and fans of so-bad-it's-good cinema.
  
## Reviews and Controversies
 
The MSG The Messenger Part 1 received largely negative reviews from critics, who accused it of being a propaganda film promoting Singh's teachings, while also severely criticising its quality. The film was rated 1/5 by The Times of India, 0.5/5 by Hindustan Times, and 0/5 by Rediff.com. [15] [16] [17] The film was also panned by international critics, such as The Guardian and The Hollywood Reporter. [18] [19]
 
The film was also controversial for being allegedly insulting towards Sikhs, who objected to Singh's portrayal as a godman and his use of religious symbols and attire. The film was banned in several states, including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir, following protests and petitions from Sikh groups. [20] [21] The film also faced legal challenges from the CBFC and the Sikh community, who sought to stop its release on grounds of hurting religious sentiments and violating the Cinematograph Act.

However, the film also received support from Singh's followers, who claimed that it was a positive and inspirational message for the youth. The film was praised by some celebrities, such as Rakhi Sawant, Subhash Ghai and Ram Gopal Varma. [24] [25] [26] The film also attracted a large number of viewers, especially in Singh's stronghold of Sirsa, where it was screened in multiple theatres with full occupancy. [27] [28]
  
## Sequel and Franchise
 
The MSG The Messenger Part 1 was followed by a direct sequel, MSG-2 The Messenger, released later in the same year.

The sequel was also co-directed, co-written and co-produced by Singh, who also composed the music and performed the stunts.

The sequel was released worldwide on September 18, 2015, followed by the Tamil and Telugu versions on October 1.

The box office gross of the sequel is also disputed, with a large difference between the numbers from box office estimates and the much higher numbers given by the film's producers. According to Box Office India, the sequel grossed about â¹8.75 crore (US$1.1 million) in its first week. [34] However, according to the producers, the sequel grossed over â¹100 crore (US$13 million) in its first week. [35] The critical reception of the sequel was similar to its predecessor, with critics considering it propaganda and a very bad film overall. [36] [37] [38]
 
The MSG franchise continued with two more films, MSG: The Warrior Lion Heart and Hind Ka Napak Ko Jawab: MSG Lion Heart 2, both featuring new and unrelated story and characters. Honeypreet Insan, Singh's daughter who co-starred in MSG-2, directed and starred in both films alongside her father. The films were released in 2016 and 2017 respectively. [39] [40]
